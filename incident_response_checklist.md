# Incident Response Checklist
For on-call engineers

## During an incident
- <input type='checkbox'> **Acknowledge the event in PagerDuty**
- <input type='checkbox'> **From the PagerDuty incident, click *More Actions* -> *Create JIRA Issue* to create a ticket on the [Production Board](https://broadworkbench.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=15&projectKey=PROD&selectedIssue=PROD-324)**
    - This will create a Jira ticket that includes some metadata about the incident, including start-time.  Update the summary and description as needed.
    - Assign to yourself if you are investigating the issue
- <input type='checkbox'>**Report in the #workbench-oncall slack channel that you are investigating event**
    - If it impacts many users:
        - Daytime: Confirm that a support specialist is aware of the issue (slack #dsde-comms or @dspsupportteam in #workbench-resilience) and can put up a FireCloud/Terra [Service Incident](https://broadinstitute.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/360003692231-Service-Notifications) and banner. Provide the Jira ticket and a description of the user impact.
        - Off-hours: [Follow this communication playbook to put up an initial banner.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E2qSIQECBBS0daWa_VXAOprdV5H_zvirgryTbxbPTDg/edit)
    - Impacts a single user (the user will need to be directly contacted)
        - Daytime: contact a support specialist for assistance (slack #dsde-comms or @dspsupportteam in #workbench-resilience). 
        - Off-hours:  There is no dedicated support schedule. Ultimately, the email to the user should explain the impact to them, the time it occurred, what workspace/submission/ was impacted, ways to remediate the issue, and how we are working to prevent this in the future. The tone should be apologetic and helpful.
